# Todoer React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to recreate this repo from scratch

Install Node.js and npm.

Open VS Code and add a new terminal.

Go to your code directory.

$_ `npx create-react-app <name-of-your-app>`

Open this folder in VS Code and open a new terminal.

$_ `git log` (Check that CRA has made your first commit.)

Open Github and click "Create a new repository" and name it the same as your folder from the create-react-app command.

Click "create" without touching anything else.

Select and copy the URL of the repo.

$_ `git remote add origin <the-name-of-your-repo>`

$_ `git remote -v` (Check that the remote origin is correct.)

$_ `git push -u origin master` (The -u flag sets the remote as upstream.)

Check your repo in Github.

Add the title to your README.md and save in VS Code.

Add a commit message like "update title in README" then press ctrl + Enter. This should push automatically to your remote repository.

Check your Github repo again. You're good to go!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
